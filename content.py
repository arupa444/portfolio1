        I am an AI Engineer specializing in the full lifecycle of intelligent systems—from sparse matrix optimization 
        research to deploying multi-agent LLM architectures. My focus is not just on model accuracy, but on 
        system efficiency, scalability, and production-grade inference. I build bridges between complex theoretical 
        research and tangible software solutions.
